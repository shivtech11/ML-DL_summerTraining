    "What are operators? Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand. There are several types of operators in Python:      \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Arithmetic operators</strong>: Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.</li>    \n",
    "    <li><strong>Relational operators</strong>: Relational operators are used to compare values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.</li>    \n",
    "    <li><strong>Logical operators</strong>: Logical operators are the ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’ operators.</li>    \n",
    "    <li><strong>Bitwise operators</strong>: Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were string of binary digits. It operates bit by bit, hence the name.</li>    \n",
    "    <li><strong>Assignment operators</strong>: Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.</li>    \n",
    "    <li><strong>Special operators</strong>: Python language offers some special type of operators like the identity operator or the membership  operator. They are described below with examples.\n",
    "        <ol>\n",
    "            <li>Identity operators: ‘is’ and ‘is not’ are the identity operators in Python. They are used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical</li>\n",
    "            <li>Membership operators: in and not in are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test whether a value or   variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).</li>\n",

    "Relational operators between two variables (say ‘a’ and ‘b’) will return True if the relation between ‘a’ and ‘b’ evaluates to true, else False will be returned. The values True and False are called Boolean variables i.e. Booleans are variables which contain truth values. \n",
    "There are many relational operators used in Python, for instance greater (>), equality (=) and so on. Suppose if ‘a’ were 10 and ‘b’ were 20, then a>b will return False because ‘a’ is obviously lesser than ‘b’. </font>\n"
